* UPDATES *
* ------- *

EMAIL 500 ERRORS TO MATT AND CHRIS OK
-------------------------------------
ADDED - https://github.com/smartinez87/exception_notification

SETTINGS PAGE LIVE UPDATE OF TOTAL HOURS
----------------------------------------
ADDED - SHOW JS TOTAL LIVE UPDATE OF ESTIMATED ACTIVITY HOURS

500 ERRORS WHEN SEARCHING FIXED
-------------------------------
FIXED

PROJECTS TABLE 
-----------------
ADDED - Add a column that has a label “Principals” - the Maintainer/Coordinator before notes, after total budget – these are roles they have possible to have an inline editor for each.... would have a dropdown of people

PROJECT TABLE
-------------
OK - increase vertical padding on each row by 20%

OK - When you change the “deadline” column, it should ajax refresh the “due in” column, because these fields are interdependent

OK - budgeted amounts (on right side of slashes) a bold font weight or (300 or whatever is stronger)


PROJECT TABLE FLOATING THEAD
----------------------------
PROJECTS TABLE MAKE THE THEAD FLOAT SO IT FOLLOWS YOU AS YOU SCROLL - LIKE THOSE ANNOYING ADS
SO ALL THE TD SHOULD BE FIXED WITH EXCEPT LAST FIELD MAYBE?
REPEAT ROW AS WORST CASE ALTERNATIVE
-- USED REPEATING ROWS EVERY 12 -- NO PROBLEM DOING THE FLOATING THING, BUT KEEPING THE TH AND TD WIDTHS IN SYNC MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE.... 

- THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE IMPROVED IN FUTURE RELEASES TO USE FLOATING CONCEPT

PROJECT SETTINGS BULK VERSION DUE DATE ADJUSTMENTS
--------------------------------------------------
ADDED:
- ABILITY TO SET ITERATION LENGTH IN DAYS, INTEGER (EG 7 DAYS) on the project settings information page, default to 7 DAYS

in edit form have a checkbox that says “adjust all subsequent versions” -- have it be checked by default....

- When you change the date of a version, all subsequent version get adjusted

users create the versions for a project before there are due dates,
so the iteration length should automatically set all due dates based on the due date of the first iteration when you set that....

versions edit template -- is where you would set the due date, and then when you submit that form, it should adjust all subsequent versions....

so we can assume that subsequent versions can be found accurately by sorting by date ascending and then alphabetical (001, 002 etc)

so it should basically always be checking the due dates of all versions and setting them in iteration sequences

redmine_time_tracker plugin
---------------------------
- but when you press “stop” it goes to a 500 error -- FIXED BY UPGRADE
- Possible to add a pause button? -- ADDED BY UPGRADE
- it should have a seconds counter -- is that possible? -- IMPLEMENTATION A BIT PECULIAR, AWKWARD SITUATION BECAUSE IT’S DOING PERIOD UPDATES VIA AJAX
